= Asciidoc

Some CircleCI documentation is written in asciidoc and built into the site using https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[jekyll-asciidoc]. Server documentation is also converted to PDF using https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf[asciidoctor-pdf] plugins.

== Server Document Structure
Server documentation is provided in two formats:

* HTML on the main CircleCI docs site showing the current docs for server 2.x 
* PDFs of our Operations and Installation guides are provided for each feature release (scroll down to the bottom of the Server Administration section in the main navigation)

Each topic/guide is written in a separate `.adoc` file, and for the purposes of PDF generation there are master `.adoc` files for: 

* Operations Guide (`_ops-guide.adoc`)
* Installation Guide (`_aws-install.adoc`) 

These "master files" combine the separate topics using the `include::jekyll/_cci2/overview.adoc[]` etc. syntax.

NOTE: Master asciidoc files that are **only** used for creating PDFs have an `_` at the start of the filenames to prevent Jekyll from converting them to HTML for the main site.

== Build PDFs locally

To be able to build PDFs locally you will need to install Asciidoctor-PDF - Instructions [here](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf#install-the-published-gem).

Then, from the top of the circleci-docs directory, run:

```sh
./scripts/build_pdfs_asciidoc.sh
```

You will then find the PDFs in: `releases/tmp`

== Build PDFs with CI

The CI config for CircleCI docs is configured to build the Operator and Installation guides on commit to any branch that starts with `server/*`. The PDFs appear as build artifacts and can be accessed from the CircleCI App


== Document Attributes

Each individual doc should begin like this:

```
= Overview                  // top level heading
:page-layout: classic-docs  // page layout to use
:page-liquid:               // apply Liquid template preprocessor to file prior to content being passed to AsciiDoc processor
:icons: font                // use font awesome icons for admonitions
:toc: macro                 // allows you to place the TOC wherever you like in the doc using toc::[]
:toc-title:                 // gives the option to customise the TOC heading
```
== Attributes for Master Docs

```
= OPERATIONS GUIDE: A guide for administrators of CircleCI Server installations. // main title 
docs@circleci.com                                                                // author           
:media: screen                                                                   // destination media type       
:title-page-background-image: image:pdf-header.png[]                             // image overlay for front page 
:imagesdir: ../assets/img/docs/                                                  // where to find images included in content
:doctype: book                                                                   // https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#document-types
:toc:                                                                            // default places TOC right after front page
:toc-title: Contents                                                             // heading to appear above TOC
:icons: font                                                                     // use font awesome icons for admonitions
:source-highlighter: rouge                                                       // use rouge syntax highlighter for PDF output
:pagenums:                                                                       // print page numbers in PDF output
:idprefix:                                                                       // by default IDs generated from section titles start with _ ... this removes it
:idseparator: -                                                                  // use - between words for IDs generated from section titles
:autofit-option:                                                                 // auto-fit code blocks to the page width  
```     

== Liquid Tags and Other Content You Do Not Want in the PDFs

Liquid, used for the Jekyll content, is not rendered during the PDF conversion process. If `{% raw %}` tags are used in Server docs pages they need to be removed from the PDF content, so that they do not appear as text in the PDF. This can be done using the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#ifndef-directive[`ifndef` directive], as follows:

```
\ifndef::pdf[{% raw %}]
code example
\ifndef::pdf[{% endraw %}]
```

== Highlight Content (useful for to do items so they don't get missed and published!)

To highlight some text in the html/pdf output just enclose it in #, as follows, leaving no gaps:

```
#text to highlight#
```

The script that builds the PDFs applies an attribute called `pdf` during the build - so any content that uses `ifndef::pdf` will **not** be included in the generated PDFs. For further information on usage and the inverse `ifdef::pdf` see the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#conditional-preprocessor-directives[Conditional Preprocessor Directives] section of the Asciidoctor user manual. **This same process can be used to create any type of content to appear on just one of our platforms.**
