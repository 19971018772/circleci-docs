== Referencing your runner on a job

After setting up the runner, you will need to reference it on a job by setting some fields in your `.circleci/config.yml` file. The fields you must set for a specific job to run using your runner are:

* `machine: true`
* `resource_class: your-namespace/your-resource`

Here is a simple example of how you could set up a job:

```yaml
version: 2.1
workflows:
  testing:
    jobs:
      - runner
jobs:
  runner:
    machine: true
    resource_class: your-namespace/your-resource
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hi I'm on Runners!"
```
The job will then execute using your runner when you push the config to your VCS provider.
