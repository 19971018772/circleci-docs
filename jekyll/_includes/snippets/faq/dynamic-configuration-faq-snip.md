## Dynamic configuration FAQs
{: #dynamic-config-faqs }

### Pipeline parameters
{: #pipeline-parameters }

**Question:** I thought pipeline parameters could only be used with the API?

**Answer:** Previously, this was true. With the dynamic configuration feature, you can now set pipeline parameters dynamically, before the pipeline is executed (triggered from either the API or a webhookâ€”a push event to your VCS).

### Custom executors
{: #custom-executors}

**Question:** Can I use a custom executor?

**Answer:** Custom executors can be used, but require certain dependencies to be installed for the continuation step to work (currently: `curl`, `jq`).

### The continuation orb
{: #the-continuation-orb }

**Question:** What is the `continuation` orb?

**Answer:** The `continuation` orb assists you in managing the pipeline continuation process. The
`continuation` orb wraps an API call to [`continuePipeline`](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/continuePipeline). Refer to the [`continuation`](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/continuation) orb
documentation for more information.

**Question:** Is it possible to **not** use the continuation orb?

**Answer:** If you have special requirements not covered by the continuation orb, you can implement the same functionality in other ways. Refer to the [orb source code](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/continuation#orb-source) to learn how the continuation functionality is implemented with the orb.
