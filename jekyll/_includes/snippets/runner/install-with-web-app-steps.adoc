//== CircleCI web app installation: pre-steps
In order to install self-hosted runners, you will need to create a namespace and resource class token. Please note that to create resource classes and tokens, you need to be an organization admin in the VCS provider. You can read about namespaces and resource classes on the <<runner-concepts#namespaces-and-resource-classes,Concepts>> page.

You can view your runners on the inventory page, by clicking *Self-Hosted Runners* on the left navigation.

. On the https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app], navigate to *Self-Hosted Runners*.

. If this is your organization's first time using self-hosted runners, you'll need to create a namespace as the first part of this step. *Each organization can only create a single namespace*. While not required, we suggest using a lowercase representation of your CircleCI account name. CircleCI will populate your org name as the suggested namespace by default in the UI.

. If your organization already use orbs, do not create a new namespace, enter the namespace your organization uses for orbs.

. The second input field is to create a name for your resource class for your organization's self-hosted runners.

. Copy and save the resource class token. Self-hosted runners use this token to claim work for the associated resource class.

+
CAUTION: The token cannot be retrieved again, so be sure to store it safely.

. You will need to follow the platform-specific installation instructions to continue. There is a **Container** tab for setting up container runner, as well as a **Machine** tab for setting up self-hosted runners in Linux, macOS, and Windows. Click the tab in the UI that is relevant to your environment.

The instructions for specific platforms can be found in the web app, but are also included in a later section in this installation guide.

. You will be presented with configuration code for your new resource class. If you have an existing `.circleci/config.yml` file, add your new resource class below the existing `jobs` section, or add the whole `jobs` section if one doesn't exist in your config. If you don't have an existing `.circleci/config.yml` file, you can create the file and copy all of the code over.
