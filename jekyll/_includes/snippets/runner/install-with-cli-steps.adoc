//== Command line installation: pre-steps
NOTE: If you are installing **self-hosted runners for server**, the CircleCI CLI needs to be configured using your server API key. Run `circleci setup` to configure the CLI and access the option to supply a new API token if required.

In order to install self-hosted runners, you will need to create a namespace and authentication token by performing the steps listed below. Please note that to create resource classes and tokens you need to be an organization administrator in the VCS provider.

You can view your installed runners in the https://app.circleci.com/[web app], by clicking *Self-Hosted Runners* on the left navigation.

. Create a namespace for your organization's self-hosted runners. Please note, CircleCI will autogenerate a namespace based on your organization's name. Verify this is the namespace you want to use. *Each organization can only create a single namespace*. We suggest using a lowercase representation of your CircleCI organization's account name. If you already use orbs, this namespace should be the same namespace orbs use.
+
If you receive an error creating a namespace, check to see if you have an existing one, and move on to step 2 below, using your existing namespace.
+
It is recommended to use the following command to create a namespace:
+
```
circleci namespace create <name> --org-id <your-organization-id>
```
+

. Create a resource class for your self-hosted runner's namespace using the following command:
+
```
circleci runner resource-class create <namespace>/<resource-class> <description> --generate-token
```
+
*Your namespace is required in the command to create your resource class.*
Example: `circleci runner resource-class create my-namespace/my-resource-class my-description --generate-token`.
+
CAUTION: The token cannot be retrieved again, so be sure to store it safely.
