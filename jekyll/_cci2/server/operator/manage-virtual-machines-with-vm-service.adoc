VM service controls how https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#machine[`machine`] executor and https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/building-docker-images[Remote Docker] jobs are run.

This section describes the available configuration options for VM service. Refer to the default `values.yaml` file for details on how to pre-scale virtual machines.

toc::[]

CAUTION: We recommend that you leave these options at their defaults until you have successfully configured and verified the core and build services of your server installation. Steps to set up VM service are provided in the installation guide for https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server/installation/phase-3-execution-environments/#aws[AWS] and https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server/installation/phase-3-execution-environments/#gcp[GCP].

WARNING: If https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/docker-layer-caching/[Docker Layer Caching (DLC)] is used, VM Service instances need to be spun up on demand. For this to happen, **either** ensure any preallocated instances are in use, **or** set both remote Docker and `machine` preallocated instance fields to `0`.

CAUTION: When using preallocated instances be aware that a cron job is scheduled to cycle through these instances once per day to ensure they do not end up in an unworkable state.

[#vm-provider]
== VM provider
The following configuration options are for the VM provider: either AWS or GCP.

[#aws]
=== AWS
You will need to add a section to your `values.yaml` file to configure VM Service to work with AWS EC2. 

[#aws-authentication]
==== Authentication
One of the following options is required:

* Either, select "IAM Keys" and provide:
** *Access Key ID* (required): https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Access Key ID] for EC2 access.
** *Secret Key* (required): https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Secret Key] for EC2 access.
+
NOTE: The Access Key and Secret Key used by VM Service differs from the policy used by object storage in the previous section.

* Or, select "IAM role" and provide:
** *Role ARN* (required): 
+
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html[Role ARN for Service Accounts] (Amazon Resource Name) for EC2 access.

[#gcp]
=== GCP
You will need to add a section to your `values.yaml` file to configure VM Service to work with Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

[#gcp-authentication]
==== Authentication

TIP: We recommend you create a unique service account used exclusively by VM Service. The Compute Instance Admin (Beta) role is broad enough to allow VM Service to operate. If you wish to make permissions more granular, you can use the
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/iam#compute.instanceAdmin[Compute Instance Admin (beta) role] documentation as reference.

Choose one of the following options:

* If you choose to use *GCP IAM Workload Identity*, use the VM service account email address (`service-account-name`@`project-id`.iam.gserviceaccount.com ) which you have created https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server/installation/3-install-execution-environments[here] in point 2 and 3 for the `workloadIdentity` field below.

* If you choose to use a *GCP Service Account JSON file*, use the contents of your https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts[service account JSON file] for `service-account` below.
