CircleCI Server is deployed into a Kubernetes cluster using a Helm chart. As such, we'll need to copy the latest images and charts from CircleCI into your virtual environment.

All images referenced in the CircleCI Helm chart must be accessible within your air-gapped environment.

[#download-all-images]
=== 1. Download all images required for this release
Download all images required for the release of CircleCI Server to your local machine. 

*Note:* These images require registry authentication in order to pull. Please contact support@circleci.com for more information.

Copy all downloaded images to the docker registry in your air-gapped environment.
