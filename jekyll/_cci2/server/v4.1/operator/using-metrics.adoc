Metrics such as CPU or memory usage and internal metrics can help you manage and debug your server installation in many ways, including:

* Quickly detecting incidents and abnormal behavior.
* Dynamically scaling compute resources.
* Retroactively understanding infrastructure-wide issues.

[#metrics-collection]
== Metrics collection

[#scope]
=== Scope
Your CircleCI server installation collects a number of metrics and logs by default, which can be useful in monitoring the health of your system and debugging issues with your installation.

[#telegraf]
=== Telegraf
Most services running on server report StatsD metrics to the https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/[Telegraf] pod running in server.
The configuration is fully customizable. Metrics can be forwarded from Telegraf to any output supported by Telegraf through https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.24/plugins/#output-plugins[output plugins]. By default, it will provide a metrics endpoint for Prometheus to scrape.

[#use-telegraf-to-forward-metrics-to-datadog]
=== Use Telegraf to forward metrics to Datadog

By default, Telegraf is configured to collect statsd metrics using the link:https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.24/plugins/#input-statsd[statsd] input plugin, and serves these metrics in the Prometheus format on the `/metrics` endpoint using the https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.24/plugins/#output-prometheus_client[Prometheus] output plugin. Refer to the `telegraf.config` block in the default `values.yaml` for details on how Telegraf is configured in CircleCI server. For details on the different Telegraf configuration options, refer to the official link:https://github.com/influxdata/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/telegraf[Telegraf] Helm chart from Influxdata.

The following example shows how to configure Telegraf to output metrics to Datadog:

In the `telgraf.config.custom_config_file` block of your helm `values.yaml`, add the `[[outputs.datadog]]` as seen below to the bottom of the config block, replacing `"my-secret-key"` with your datadog API key.

[source,yaml]
----
telegraf:
  config:
    custom_config_file: |
      ...
      [[outputs.datadog]]
        ## Replace "my-secret-key" with Datadog API key
        apikey = "my-secret-key"
      ...
----

NOTE: For more options, see the https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.24/plugins/#output-datadog[Telegraf docs].

Finally, you will need to apply the changes via helm update.

[source,shell]
helm upgrade circleci-server oci://cciserver.azurecr.io/circleci-server -n <namespace> --version <version> -f <path-to-values.yaml> --username $USERNAME --password $PASSWORD

Note: If your Telegraf pod does not restart after your helm upgrade, then the changes will not take effect. You may gracefully restart your Telegraf instance with command below. This will restart Telegraf with zero downtime.

[source,shell]
kubectl rollout restart deploy telegraf -n <namespace>
