[#create-buckets-in-minio]
== Create buckets in MinIO
As an air-gapped object storage solution, CircleCI Server supports MinIO. It is used in an air-gapped environment as a replacement for a Cloud-based object storage solution such as GCP GCS or AWS S3. With an air-gapped MinIO instance installed, complete the following steps.

[#create-circleci-data-bucket]
=== 1. Create a circleci-data bucket.
Create a new bucket in MinIO named `circleci-data`. This bucket can be named differently, but references to it will need to be updated in the Helm values.yaml file.

[#configure-circleci-data-bucket]
=== 2. Configure the circleci-data bucket.
In the settings for the `circleci-data` bucket, change the access policy to `public`.

[#copy-circleci-build-agent]
== Copy the CircleCI build agent
Copy the latest CircleCI build agent into MinIO within your air-gapped environment.

[#download-latest-release-txt]
=== 1. Download the latest release.txt file
Download the latest https://circleci-binary-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-agent/release.txt[release.txt file] from CircleCI's public S3 bucket.

[source, bash]
----
wget https://circleci-binary-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-agent/release.txt
----

[#copy-release-txt]
=== 2. Copy the release.txt file to MinIO
Copy the `release.txt` file to your air-gapped environment and place it in the root of the `circleci-data` bucket in MinIO.

[#retrieve-latest-release-bin]
=== 3. Retrieve the latest release binary
Using the `release.txt` file, retrieve and download the latest `circleci-agent` release and checksums from the CircleCI binary releases public bucket.

[source, bash]
----
LATEST_RELEASE=$(cat release.txt)

# Download circleci-agent
wget https://circleci-binary-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-agent/$LATEST_RELEASE/linux/amd64/circleci-agent

# Download checksums
wget https://circleci-binary-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-agent/$LATEST_RELEASE/checksums.txt
----


[#create-release-dir]
=== 4. Create a release directory in the circleci-data bucket
Using the version specified in `release.txt`, create a new directory in the root of the `circleci-data` bucket with the name of that release.

```
# In this example, we are creating a directory at the root of circleci-data in MinIO with the following name:
1.0.137184-db08738f
```

[#upload-checksums-file]
=== 5. Upload the checksums.txt file to the newly created directory.
Copy the downloaded `checksums.txt` file from step 3 to your virtual environment, and place it in MinIO nested under the newly created release directory in step 4.

```
# The structure of the directory should now look like this
1.0.137184-db08738f/
  checksums.txt
```

[#create-new-subdirs]
=== 6. Create two new subdirectories in the release directory
Within the release directory created in step 4, create two new nested subdirectories, first `linux`, and then within it, `amd64`.

```
# The structure of the directory of the bucket should look like this:
1.0.137184-db08738f/
  checksums.txt
  linux/
    amd64/
```

image::./minio/minio_create_amd_dir.png[Creating an amd dir]

[#copy-build-agent-bin]
=== 6. Copy the downloaded circleci-agent file
Copy the downloaded `circleci-agent` file from step 3 to your virtual environment, and place it in the amd64 directory created in step 6.

```
# The final structure of the bucket should look similar to this:
1.0.137184-db08738f/
  checksums.txt
  linux/
    amd64/
      circleci-agent
```
