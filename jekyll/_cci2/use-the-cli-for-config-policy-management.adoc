NOTE: Config policy management is available on the **Scale** plan and is currently in **open preview**. All aspects of the feature are subject to change.

CAUTION: Ensure you have authenticated your version of the CLI with a token, and updated the CLI, before attempting to use the CLI for config policy management. See the link:/docs/local-cli[Installing the Local CLI] page for more information.

Use the CircleCI CLI to manage your organization's policies programmatically. The sub-commands to perform policy management are grouped under the `policy` command. 

The following sub-commands are currently supported within the CLI for configuration policy management:

* `diff` - shows the difference between local and remote policy bundles
* `push` - pushes the policy bundle (activate policy bundle)
* `fetch` - fetches the policy bundle (or one policy, based on name) from remote

For example, running the following command activates a policy bundle stored at `./policy_bundle_dir_path`:

[source,shell]
----
circleci policy push ./policy_bundle_dir_path --owner-id <your-organization-ID>
----

[NOTE]
====
The organization ID is required, and is provided with `--owner-id` flag. To find your organization/user ID, select **Organization Settings** in the CircleCI web app side bar.

== Create and upload a policy 

Follow these steps to create a policy that checks the `version` of CircleCI config files to ensures it is greater than or equal to `2.1`.

. Create a policy file in an empty directory. For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
mkdir ./config-policies
----

. Inside your new directory create a `rego` file for our new policy, for example, `version.rego`.

. Add the following content to `version.rego`:
+
[source,rego]
----
# All policies start with the org package definition
package org

policy_name["example"]

# signal to circleci that check_version is enabled and must be included when making a decision
enable_rule["check_version"]

# signal to circleci that check_version is a hard_failure condition and that builds should be
# stopped if this rule is not satisfied.
hard_fail["check_version"]

# define check version
check_version = reason {
    not input.version # check the case where version is not in the input
    reason := "version must be defined"
} {
    not is_number(input.version) # check that version is number
    reason := "version must be a number"
} {
    not input.version >= 2.1 # check that version is at least 2.1
    reason := sprintf("version must be at least 2.1 but got %s", [input.version])
}
----

. Upload your policy to your organization:
+
[source,shell]
----
circleci-cli policy push ./config --owner-id <your-organization-ID>
----
+
Now, when a pipeline is triggered within your organization, the project's `.circleci/config.yml` will be validated against this policy.

== Update a policy

To illustrate making a change to an existing policy, suppose you made an error when creating that policy, and that configs in your organization are using CircleCI config version `2.0` and that you want your policy to reflect this.

. Change the rule definition in your `version.rego` file:
+
[source,rego]
----
{
    not input.version >= 2.0 # check that version is at least 2.0
    reason := sprintf("version must be at least 2.0 but got %s", [input.version])
}
----

. Push the policy directory containing the updated policy file using the CLI (verify the diff, and choose yes when prompted):
+
[source,shell]
----
circleci-cli policy push ./config --owner-id <your-organization-ID>
----

== Manage policies with your VCS

CircleCI policies are managed by pushing directories of policies to CircleCI via the CLI. We recommend manageing your policy directory via your VCS by storing your policies in a repository within your organization.

This is how policies are managed internally at CircleCI. Pushing policy bundles is done by triggering CircleCI pipelines.

We also recommend creating a bot account for pushing policies and to use its associated CircleCI token. The context should be restricted to groups that are responsible for managing policies. See Restricted Contexts.

=== Set up config policy management with your VCS

. Set up repository in your VCS to manage policies.

. Create a directory for your `rego` policy files, for example:
+
[source,shell]
----
mkdir ./config-policies
----

- Set up a `.circleci/config.yml` file for your policies repository. This example will push policies to CircleCI on commits to `main` and show a diff of the policy bundle on commits to all other branches otherwise:
+

          command: circleci policy push ./config --no-prompt --owner-id $OWNER_ID
----

Let us break down the previous config:

The following orb makes the `circleci-cli/default` executor available to our jobs

```yaml
orbs:
  circleci-cli: circleci/circleci-cli@0.1.9
```

We then declare two jobs: `diff-policy-bundle` and `push-policy-bundle` to run the policy diff and push commands respectively.

Note that `$OWNER_ID` is an environment variable setup in project settings that is simply your organization id.
Your organization id is a uuid value that can be found on the organization settings page. 

```yaml
jobs:
  diff-policy-bundle:
    executor: circleci-cli/default
    resource_class: small
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Diff policy bundle
          command: circleci policy diff ./config --owner-id $OWNER_ID

  push-policy-bundle:
    executor: circleci-cli/default
    resource_class: small
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Push policy bundle
          command: circleci policy push ./config --no-prompt --owner-id $OWNER_ID
```

We declare a workflow to run the diff job when not on branch `main` and the push job only on branch `main`

```yaml
workflows:
  main-workflow:
    jobs:
      - diff-policy-bundle:
          context: [ security-operations ]
          filters:
            branches:
              ignore: main
      - push-policy-bundle:
          context: [ security-operations ]
          filters:
            branches:
              only: main
```

Note the context for each job: `security-operations`. This context name is arbitrary, however a context is needed to authenticate the CLI. The context must declare an environment variable `CIRCLECI_CLI_TOKEN` that will be used by the CLI.
