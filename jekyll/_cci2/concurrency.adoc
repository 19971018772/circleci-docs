This documentation summarizes concurrency, and suggests ways to use concurrency to your advantage. 

In CircleCI, **concurrency** refers to utilizing multiple containers to run multiple builds at the same time. This is different from CircleCI **parallelism**, which is test-splitting across multiple containers. If you would like information on parallelism, visit the <<parallelism-faster-jobs/#,Running Tests in Parallel>> page.

Every plan with CircleCI includes the ability to concurrently run jobs. However, the number of jobs you can run concurrently differs between plans. Please view the https://circleci.com/pricing/[pricing page] to see up to date information on the number of concurrent job runs included in your plan.

== Concurrency
Concurrency allows multiple jobs to be run at the same time in a workflow through the use of multiple containers. To keep the system stable for all CircleCI customers, we implement different soft concurrency limits on each of the <<configuration-reference/#resourceclass,resource classes>> for different executors. 

If jobs are queued, it is possible you are hitting these limits. Hitting your limit may depend on a few factors, such as how many people in your organization are running jobs at once, or if you have overlapping workflows.

Customers on a Performance or Scale plan can request an increase to those limits at no extra charge by contacting https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[CircleCI support].

=== Concurrency in workflows
To run a set of concurrent jobs, you will need to add a new `workflows` section to the end of your existing `.circleci/config.yml` file. With CircleCI `version: 2.1`, you do not need to specify a `version` in the new `workflows` section. If you are still using CircleCI `version: 2`, you will need to specify the `version` in the `workflows` section.

The simple example below shows the default workflow orchestration with two concurrent jobs. The `workflows` key needs to have a unique name. In this example, the unique name is `build_and_test`. The `jobs` key is nested under the uniquely named workflow, and contains the list of job names. Since the jobs have no dependencies, they will run concurrently.

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/<language>:<version TAG>
        auth:
          username: mydockerhub-user
          password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: <command>
  test:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/<language>:<version TAG>
        auth:
          username: mydockerhub-user
          password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: <command>
workflows:
  build_and_test:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test
```
If you are still using `version: 2`, your `workflows` section will need to be adjusted to include the version.

```yaml
...
workflows:
  version: 2
  build_and_test:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test
...
```

=== Fan-out/fan-in workflow example
A more complex example of using concurrent workflows is running a common build job, fanning-out to run a set of acceptance test jobs concurrently, and then fanning-in to run a common deploy job. This flow is illustrated below.

image::fan-out-in.png[Fan-out and Fan-in Workflow]

The `.circleci/config.yml` snippet below is an example of a `workflows` section configured for fan-out/fan-in job execution. In this example, as soon as the `build` job finishes successfully, all four acceptance test `jobs` start. The `deploy` job must wait for all four acceptance test jobs to complete successfully before it starts.

```yaml
...
workflows:
  build_accept_deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - acceptance_test_1:
          requires:
            - build
      - acceptance_test_2:
          requires:
            - build
      - acceptance_test_3:
          requires:
            - build
      - acceptance_test_4:
          requires:
            - build
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - acceptance_test_1
            - acceptance_test_2
            - acceptance_test_3
            - acceptance_test_4
...
```

Please note, if you are using CircleCI `version: 2`, you will need to specify the version in the `workflows` section, above the workflow name (in this example,` build_accept_deploy`). The snippet assumes you are using CircleCI `version: 2.1`, which does not need to be specified in `workflows`.
