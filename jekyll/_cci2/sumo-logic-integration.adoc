Gain insights into your pipelines with the included dashboard panels. Filter each panel for specific projects or jobs, over any period of time. Available dashboard panels include:

- Total Jobs Ran
- Job Health (% success)
- Summary
- Jobs Ran Per Project
- Daily Performance
- Jobs Per Day
- 5 Most Recent Failed Jobs
- 5 Most Recent Failed Workflows
- Top 10 Longest Workflows (Averaged)
- Top 10 Longest Running Jobs
- Average Job Runtime Per Day

Install the CircleCI dashboard by using the App Catalog from the dashboard home page.

NOTE: This dashboard receives data through the link:https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/sumologic/sumologic[Sumo Logic orb] which must be included in your projects to be tracked.

[#set-up-sumo-logic-metrics-using-circleci-webhooks]
== Set up Sumo Logic metrics using CircleCI webhooks

To begin collecting and visualizing data with Sumo Logic, first configure CircleCI webhooks to send metrics data to Sumo Logic.

[#configure-webhooks]
=== Configure Webhooks

[#step-1-configure-hosted-collector]
==== 1. Configure hosted collector

Follow the Sumo Logic documentation for link:https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Hosted-Collectors/Configure-a-Hosted-Collector[Configuring a Hosted Collector].

[#step-2-add-an-http-source]
==== 2. Add an HTTP Source

To get the URL where the CircleCI webhooks will be sent and recorded to the collector, link:https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Sources/02Sources-for-Hosted-Collectors/HTTP-Source[add an HTTP Source].

When complete, copy the generated “HTTP Source Address”. You can always get this link from Sumo Logic again in the future. This is the URL that will need to be entered in the **Webhooks** section of the CircleCI web app in the next step.

##### **Step 3. Configure Project Webhooks**
{: #step-3-configure-project-webhooks }

For each project on CircleCI you wish to track, configure a webhook directed at the HTTP Source Address.
Follow the [CircleCI docs for configuring webhooks]({{ site.baseurl }}/webhooks/#setting-up-a-hook).

When configuring the webooks, ensure to include both the “workflow-completed”, and “job-completed” events.

### Install the CircleCI App for Sumo Logic
{: #install-the-circleci-app-for-sumo-logic }

Now that you have set up collection, install the Sumo Logic App for CircleCI to use the preconfigured searches and Dashboards that provide insight into your CI Pipeline.

#### To install the CircleCI app for Sumo Logic:
{: #to-install-the-circleci-app-for-sumo-logic }

1. Locate and install the CircleCI app from the App Catalog. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.
2. Select the version of the service you are using and click **Add to Library**. Version selection is applicable only to a few apps currently. For more information, see the [Install the Apps from the Library](https://help.sumologic.com/05Search/Library/Apps-in-Sumo-Logic/Install-Apps-from-the-Library) document.
3. To install the app, complete the following fields.
  - **App Name**. You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app.
  - **Data Source**. Select either of these options for the data source:
    - Choose **Source Category**, and select a source category from the list.
    - Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter**, and enter a custom source category beginning with an underscore. Example: `(_sourceCategory=MyCategory)`.
  - **Advanced**. Select the Location in Library (the default is the Personal folder in the Library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your Personal folder, or wherever you set to be the default in your library. From here, you can share it with your organization.
Panels will start to fill automatically. It is important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you will see full graphs and maps.
