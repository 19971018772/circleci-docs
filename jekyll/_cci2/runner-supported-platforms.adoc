== Available CircleCI self-hosted runner platforms

CircleCI self-hosted runners are available on multiple platforms. Support levels fall into two categories:

* <<Supported>>
* <<Preview>>

=== Supported

*Supported* Level platforms ensure that CircleCI self-hosted runners are both built and tested on their respective systems.

With a *Supported* platform, users receive the following:

* Documentation and best practices
* Support: CircleCI customer engineers will assist customers to resolve issues within their usual Advanced Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

*Supported* CircleCI self-hosted runners are available on the following platforms:

* Ubuntu 18.04 or later (x86_64 or ARM64)
* RHEL8 (x86_64 or ARM64)
* Mac OS X 10.15+ (Intel)
* macOS 11.2+ (Apple M1)
* Docker (x86_64 or ARM64)
* Kubernetes (x86_64)
* Windows Server 2019, 2016 (x86_64)

=== Preview

On *Preview* Level platforms, CircleCI self-hosted runners are currently in development, thus testing is not complete.

With a *Preview* platform, users receive the following:

* A full integration that is a work-in-progress -- thus, some manual configuration may be required to install, configure, and deploy
* Work-in-progress documentation and best practices
* Support: CircleCI Customer Engineers will provide assistance and guidance on best practices for installing, configuring, and operating CircleCI self-hosted runners
** Users are encouraged to provide feedback in order to rapidly improve the CircleCI self-hosted runner user experience and meet its necessary criteria as a *Supported* platform

*Preview* CircleCI self-hosted runners are available on the following platforms:

* Additional Linux distributions - RHEL, SUSE, Debian, etc. (x86_64 or ARM64)
* Kubernetes (ARM64)
