// ## Benefits of CircleCI
// {: #benefits-of-circleci }

// CircleCI runs nearly one million jobs per day in support of 30,000 organizations. Organizations choose CircleCI because jobs run fast and builds can be optimized for speed.

// CircleCI can be configured to run very complex pipelines efficiently with sophisticated [caching,]({{site.baseurl}}/caching/) [docker layer caching,]({{site.baseurl}}/docker-layer-caching/) and [resource classes]({{site.baseurl}}/optimizations/#resource-class) for running on faster machines.

// As a developer using CircleCI you can:
// - [SSH into any job]({{site.baseurl}}/ssh-access-jobs/) to debug your build issues.
// - Set up [parallelism]({{site.baseurl}}/parallelism-faster-jobs/) in your [.circleci/config.yml]({{site.baseurl}}/configuration-reference/) file to run jobs faster.
// - Configure [caching]({{site.baseurl}}/caching/) with two simple keys to reuse data from previous jobs in your [workflow]({{site.baseurl}}/workflows/).
// - Configure self-hosted [runners]({{site.baseurl}}/runner-overview/) for unique platform support.
// - Access [Arm resources]({{site.baseurl}}/arm-resources/) for the machine executor.
// - Use [orbs]({{site.baseurl}}/orb-intro/), reusable packages of configuration, to integrate with third parties.
// - Use pre-built Docker [images]({{site.baseurl}}/circleci-images/) in a variety of languages.
// - Use the [API](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/) to retrieve information about jobs and workflows.
// - Use the [CLI]({{site.baseurl}}/local-cli/) to access advanced tools locally.
// - Get flaky test detection with [test insights]({{site.baseurl}}/insights-tests/).

// As an operator or administrator of CircleCI installed on your own servers, CircleCI provides monitoring and insights into your builds and uses [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) for scheduling.

// See the [CircleCI Operations and Installation Guides]({{site.baseurl}}/server-3-overview/) for complete server documentation.
