== Introduction

As a scheduled pipeline is a triggered pipeline, and it will run every workflow in the configuration. You can filter workflows with set conditionals to keep the scheduled pipelines running only when you want them to run. One way is through built-in pipeline values, and one way is through custom pipeline parameters.

[#schedule-using-built-in-pipeline-values]
## Schedule using built-in pipeline values

One way to implement workflows filtering is by using pipeline values. The example below uses the built in pipeline values `pipeline.trigger_source` and `pipeline.schedule.name`.

```yaml
version: 2.1
...
daily-run-workflow:
  when:
    and:
      - equal: [ scheduled_pipeline, << pipeline.trigger_source >> ]
      - equal: [ your_schedule_name, << pipeline.schedule.name >> ]
  jobs:
    - test
    - build

nightly-run-workflow:
  when:
    and:
      - equal: [ scheduled_pipeline, << pipeline.trigger_source >> ]
      - equal: [ your_schedule_name, << pipeline.schedule.name >> ]
  jobs:
    - build
    - deploy
...
```

Note that in the above example, the second `equal` under `when` is not strictly necessary. The `pipeline.schedule.name` is an available pipeline value when the pipeline is triggered by a schedule.

You may also add filtering for workflows that should *not* run when a schedule is triggered:

{% raw %}
```yaml
version: 2.1
...
daily-run-workflow:
  when:
    and:
      - equal: [ scheduled_pipeline, << pipeline.trigger_source >> ]
      - equal: [ your_schedule_name, << pipeline.schedule.name >> ]
  jobs:
    - test
    - build

nightly-run-workflow:
  when:
    not:
      equal: [ scheduled_pipeline, << pipeline.trigger_source >> ]
  jobs:
   - build
   - deploy
...
```
{% endraw %}

For a full list of pipeline values, visit the xref:pipeline-variables/#pipeline-values[Pipeline values and parameters] page.

[#schedule-using-pipeline-parameters]
## Schedule using pipeline parameters

In the example below, a parameter is created called `run-schedule`, which is set as `type: boolean` and `default: false`. This allows the workflows section to use `when` to specify conditionals about when the pipeline should run. If you use the `when` conditional, you will also need to set a `when: not:`, like in the example below.

```yaml
version: 2.1
...
# set pipeline parameters
parameters:
  run-schedule:
    type: boolean
    default: false

workflows:
  # do not run the scheduled pipeline if build-test-deploy
  build-test-deploy:
    when:
      not: << pipeline.parameters.run-schedule >>
    jobs:
      - test
      - build
  # run the scheduled pipeline if nightly-snapshot
  nightly-snapshot:
    when: << pipeline.parameters.run-schedule >>
    jobs:
      - build
      - deploy
...
```

[#set-up-multiple-workflows-with-multiple-schedules]
== Set up multiple workflows with multiple schedules

The example below demonstrates three workflows scheduled with pipeline values. Two workflows will run on the same schedule (`daily_build`), and one will run on a different schedule (`weekly_build`).

```yaml
version: 2.1
...
workflows:
  daily-run-workflow:
    when: 
      equal: [ daily_build, << pipeline.schedule.name >> ]
    jobs:
      - job-one

  nightly-run-workflow:
    when: 
      equal: [ daily_build, << pipeline.schedule.name >> ]
    jobs:
      - job-two

  weekly-run-workflow:
    when: 
      equal: [ weekly_build, << pipeline.schedule.name >> ]
    jobs:
      - job-three
...
```
