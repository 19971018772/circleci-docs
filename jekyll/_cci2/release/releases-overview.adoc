Visualise and control deployments to your Kubernetes cluster with CircleCI release environments.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

CircleCI release environments give you visibility into your Kubernetes deployments in the CircleCI web app, as well as access to controls for release management. From the releases dashboard, you can:

* Restore a version
* Scale a version
* Restart a version

CircleCI releases supports link:https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/[Argo Rollouts] for progressive delivery. Some further controls are available from the releases dashboard for projects that use Argo Rollouts:

* Retry release
* Promote release
* Cancel release
