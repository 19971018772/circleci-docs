[#overview]
== Overview

This document outlines the CircleCI Android images release, update, and deprecation policy.

This policy applies to all CircleCI Android images built for the machine executor.

[#release-policy]
== Release policy

Android images are released once a month, with patch releases potentially being made for security issues. These images are generally built on top of the latest version of our currently stable base Ubuntu image. 

We install the most up-to-date versions of each tool/package in newly built images. Additionally, we aim to package the last 5 years of android API levels, with a limit of 6 levels, with each image release, along with the highest Java LTS version at the time that will allow a good level of backwards compatibility.

As the Android image is not specifically designed for the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP), some updates may come later than desired. However, we aim to follow compatibility matrices for https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html[Gradle] and https://developer.android.com/build/releases/gradle-plugin#updating-gradle[AGP]. 

Beta and Developer releases of Android tooling may be included at our discretion if there is a demand for such releases.

Monthly releases may be skipped if there are no material updates to core Android functionality, such as sdkmanager, ndk or platform versions.

Android images may not always track the latest CircleCI base image version. When we decide to update this is based on a number of factors such as compatibility, stability, or as part of a planned larger update to images. We will try to make these changes known as early as possible in our release posts on the https://discuss.circleci.com/[Discuss forum].

[#tagging]
== Tagging

Tags are separated into two distinct types of tags: `edge` tags and dated tags.

* `edge` tags are reserved for previews of new releases, which will initially point to this tag. The `edge` tags may include incremental updates to the current monthly image release, which may change without notice, and should not be used for production CI workloads. 

* Android images are generally released on a monthly basis. The date-based tagging conventions take the format of `<year>.<month>.<patch>`, such as `2023.04.1`. These images are published to `edge` first, and after a couple of days to allow for testing and ensure stability, are released to a date-based tag.

Typically, only one image is released each month. However a patch can be released when required. These typically occur for security or stability reasons.

[#critical-cve-patches]
== Critical CVE patches

When critical CVEs are disclosed that affect the versions of the operating system or software stack in our Android images, we will investigate the impact that this has on our images being used within the CircleCI execution environment. 

In most cases, due to the ephemeral and isolated nature of the containers in the environment, it is not necessary to patch these images. We will always communicate our stance on these disclosures via our Discuss Forum.

[#bug-reports-issues-and-prs]
== Bug Reports, issues, and PRs

Please file a https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[support ticket] with CircleCI Support for any issues or bugs found with the Android images. Our Support Team will be able to escalate issues internally to the correct engineering team and provide updates on the issue.

For the CircleCI Android Docker convenience image, we welcome bug reports and PRs from our community via GitHub. The GitHub repository for this image can be found via the https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/android[Developer Hub].

As a general rule, minor, non-blocking bugs will be fixed in the next release of the image. For major/blocking changes, we will patch the existing live image, depending on how old the image is.

For issues and PRs that are requesting new features in the image, we ask that justification and scope is provided. Keeping the images small in size and simple to build, whilst providing the most functionality is our main aim.

While we make every effort to respond to issues and PRs in a timely manner, we do not provide an official SLA for this.
 
[#image-lifespan-eol]
== Image lifespan / EOL

Android images will be fully supported for a minimum of 1 calendar year after release.

Around September each year, coinciding roughly with when new versions of Android are released, we will deprecate images from the previous year and retain only the quarterly releases (January, April, July, October). The deprecated images will be removed 3 months after deprecation. During this same deprecation cycle, we will also flag images older than 3 years for removal.

When an image is selected for deprecation and removal, we will create an announcement on our Discuss forum, along with reaching out via email to developers who have requested one of the deprecated images in their recent jobs.

An example deprecation is detailed in the table below. This example is based on September 2023 deprecations, with “Year 1” being the current year (September 2022 to September 2023).

Android convenience images are not removed from Docker Hub once published. However, we encourage customers to migrate to newer images where possible as per the deprecation cycle for Android VM images above.

[#exceptions]
== Exceptions

​​At any time, we reserve the right to work outside of the information in this document if the circumstances require. In the event that we are required to make an exception to the policy, we will aim to provide as much notice and clarity as possible. In these cases, an announcement will be posted on our Discuss Forum, along with additional outreach, such as an email notice, where possible.
