This guide gets you started with creating a new project in CircleCI.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* A CircleCI account connected to your code. You can link:https://circleci.com/signup/[sign up for free].
* A code repository you want to build on CircleCI.

== Build a new project on CircleCI

The authentication method used to set up your CircleCI account determins the definition of "project" in CircleCI, as well as the permissions management processes available to you:

* If you authenticated using **GitHub OAuth**, or **Bitbucket**, a "project" in CircleCI maps directly to a "repository" in GitHub. Follow steps to <<set-up-a-project>> below.
* If you authenticated through **GitLab**, a "project" within CircleCI is a standalone entity that you create and then associate with a code repository. Follow steps to <<create-a-project>> below.

=== Set up a project

NOTE: Starting June 14, 2023, you may see a simplified experience when setting up a project on CircleCI.  See our link:https://discuss.circleci.com/t/product-update-simplifying-circleci-project-creation/48336[community forum] for more details.

Follow these steps to create a new project in CircleCI:

. In CircleCI, click **Projects** in the sidebar.
. Find your project and click the blue **Set Up Project** button next to it.

If you cannot see your project, check you have selected the correct organization in the top left-hand corner of CircleCI.

+
Once you have set up your project, you will be prompted to provide a `config.yml` file.

. From the pop-up window, select your preferred option. You can either:
+
* Include a `config.yml` in the `.circleci` directory of your repo.
* Commit a starter CI pipeline to a new branch of your repo.
* Use an editable `config.yml` template.
+
If you choose the starter CI pipeline, a sample `config.yml` file is created and committed to a `circleci-project-setup` branch in your repo.
+
For guidance on creating a `config.yml` file, see <<config-intro#,Configuration Introduction>>.
+
. Click the blue **Set Up Project** button.

CircleCI then uses the specified `config.yml` file to run your pipeline. You can see the output in the CircleCI dashboard.

To make changes to your pipeline, either edit the `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repo, or click the ellipsis next your project in the Dashboard and choose **Configuration File**.

This opens the CircleCI Configuration Editor, from where you can edit and commit your `config.yml` file.
