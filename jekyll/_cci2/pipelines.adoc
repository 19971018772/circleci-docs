:page-description: This document introduces the concept of pipelines and shows how pipelines can be triggered and what they include.

CircleCI pipelines are the highest-level unit of work, encompassing a project's full configuration (for example, `.circleci/config.yml`, or multiple configuraiton files if that is how your project is set up). Pipelines coordinate the execution of workflows and jobs to build, test, and deploy your code. Workflows can be conditional, based on xref:workflows#using-contexts-and-filtering-in-your-workflows[filters], xref:workflows#workflows-configuration-examples[job requirements], and xref:selecting-a-workflow-to-run-using-pipeline-parameters#[pipeline parameters].

Pipelines include your workflows, which coordinate your jobs. Pipelines have a fixed, linear lifecycle, and are associated with a specific actor. Pipelines trigger when a change is pushed to a project that has a CircleCI configuration file included, and can also be scheduled, triggered manually through the CircleCI app, or using the API.

== Dashboard
When visiting your CircleCI dashboard, you are shown a list of recently-triggered pipelines for your organization.

[#pipeline-architecture]
== Pipeline architecture

A pipeline is composed of workflows, which are composed of jobs. By navigating from a pipeline to a specific job, you can access your job output, test results, and artifacts through several tabs.

The output of each job can be opened in a new tab (in either raw or formatted styling) with a unique link, making it shareable between team members.

== Configuration sources and project triggers

NOTE: The information in this section on configuration sources and triggers applies to accounts integrated with the xref:github-apps-integration#[CircleCI GitHub App] or xref:gitlab-integration#[GitLab]. There are two GitHub integration types, either OAuth or through the GitHub App. To find out which GitHub integration type you have refer to the xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App integration] page.

#Add some information about why people want to go and add these things. On the Multiple config files setup page for GitHub app we have: You can use multiple configuration files in a CircleCI project and set up separate triggers for each one. Each configuration triggers a separate pipeline on a trigger event. If your existing configuration file is getting too large to manage, consider splitting it into multiple files.#

=== Configuration source

Configuration sources show CircleCI where a pipeline configuration for your project is stored. A configuration source can be set up for use when _triggering_ a pipeline.

A project can have one or more configuration sources. Configurations include, but are not limited to, a `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repository.

When you create a project in CircleCI and connect it to a repository, a configuraiton source is set up for you automatically, and connected to a configuration file. The connected configuration file will be either a file you commit  yourself or one generated by CircleCI based on the code in your project.

==== Add a configuraiton source

TIP: If you created a project xref:create-project#[in the CircleCI web app] you will find a configuration source is already set up.

image::{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/add-configuration-source.png[Add a configuration source]

To add a configuration source, follow these steps:

. In the CircleCI web app, click on **Projects** in the sidebar
. Click on the ellipsis next to your project (icon:ellipsis-h[]) and then click **Project Settings**
. Select **Configuration** in the sidebar
. Click btn:[Add Configuration Source]
. Complete the form fields and options:
** Give your configuraiton source a descriptive name
** Under Configuration Source select the platform that matches where your project is set up (for example, GitHub App)
+
NOTE: For GitLab Self-managed, you can input any instance that you have previously set up in CircleCI. If you wish to set a different feature branch or repository from a self-managed instance as a new configuration source, you will first need to add a new connection via your xref:gitlab-integration#organization-settings-integrations[menu:Organization Settings[Integrations]]. In either case, you will also need to enter your personal access token again to authorize this connection.
** Authorize your connection if this is not already showing with a icon:check-circle[]
** Select your project repository
** Select a fallback branch to use in case you try to build on a branch with no configuration defined
** Enter the path to your configuraiton file relative to the root of your repository. For example, `.circleci/config.yml`
. Click btn:[Save]

Once you have set up a configuration source you need to set up a project trigger to connect it to. This is described in the following section.

=== Project triggers

TIP: If you created a project xref:create-project#[in the CircleCI web app] you will find a trigger is already set up.

A project can have one or more triggers, which are associated with events from a source of change. Triggers include, but are not limited to, a push to a branch on a version control system (VCS), for example, a GitHub repository. A trigger determines an event (or events) along with a configuration source to define a pipeline.

A trigger kicks off a pipeline to run the workflows defined by your connected configuration source.

==== GitHub App project triggers

When the CircleCI GitHub App is installed for your organization, GitHub starts to send events for the repositories you have granted access to. When a trigger is created CircleCI has enough information to use the event data to determine if a pipeline should be triggered.

==== GitLab project triggers

When a trigger is created, CircleCI registers a webhook with GitLab. Push events from GitLab are sent to CircleCI. CircleCI then uses the event data to determine _if_ a pipeline should run, and if so, _which_ pipeline should be run.

In addition to a configuration source, each trigger includes the webhook URL, and in this scenario, a CircleCI-created GitLab token. The webhook URL and GitLab token are used to securely register the webhook within GitLab in order to receive push events from your GitLab repository.

**Trigger filters** allow you to determine when a trigger should initiate a build based on the parameters provided by Gitlabâ€™s webhook. CircleCI provides some common options, for example, only build on merge requests, but you can also build your own rules using the custom filter option. For example, a custom filter would allow you to only build on a specific branch or user.

==== Add a project trigger

image::{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/add-project-trigger.png[Add a project trigger]

To add a project trigger for a configuraiton source, follow these steps:

. In the link:https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app] select **Projects** in the sidebar
. Find your project in the list, click the ellipsis (icon:ellipsis-h[]) next to it and select **Project Settings**
. Select **Triggers** in the sidebar
. Click btn:[Add Trigger]
. Select the same location in the "Connect to" dropdown menu that you selected for your configuration source (for example, GitHub App)
. Click btn:[Next]
. Complete the form fields and options:
** Give your trigger a descriptive name
** Authorize your connection if this is not already showing with a icon:check-circle[]
+
NOTE: For GitLab self-managed you can enter the URL for an instance you have previously set up with CircleCI. You will need to enter the relevant personal access token again here to authorize the connection.
** Select your project repository from the dropdown
** Choose your configuration source from the "Choose config to run" menu
** (Optional) If you are using GitLab you can configure <<gitlab-project-triggers,trigger filters>>
. Click btn:[Save]

#We should give a step here, something like - Commit a change to your project to check the trigger is set up correctly?#

[#visual-studio-code-extension]
== VS Code extension

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can also monitor and interact with your pipelines directly from VS Code with the link:/docs/vs-code-extension-overview/[official CircleCI extension]. The extension allows you to customize which projects and pipelines you want to follow, as well as view job logs and test results, download artifacts, approve, re-run, and debug jobs with SSH, and get notified when your workflows fail or need approval.

image::/docs/assets/img/docs/vs_code_extension_job-details.png[Screenshot showing the detailed view of a failed test]

The CircleCI VS Code extension is available to download on the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=circleci.circleci[VS Code marketplace.]
