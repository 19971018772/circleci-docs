CircleCI pipelines are the highest-level unit of work, encompassing a project's full `.circleci/config.yml` file. Pipelines include your workflows, which coordinate your jobs. Pipelines have a fixed, linear lifecycle, and are associated with a specific actor. Pipelines trigger when a change is pushed to a project that has a CircleCI configuration file included, and can also be scheduled, triggered manually through the CircleCI app, or using the API.

== Dashboard
When visiting your CircleCI dashboard, you are shown a list of recently triggered pipelines for your organization/account.

[#pipeline-architecture]
== Pipeline architecture

A pipeline is composed of workflows, which are composed of jobs. By navigating from a pipeline to a specific job, you can access your job output, test results, and artifacts through several tabs.

The output of each job can be opened in a new tab (in either raw or formatted styling) with a unique link, making it shareable between team members.

=== Configuration sources and project triggers

NOTE: The information in this section applies to accounts integrated with the xref:github-apps-integration#[CircleCI GitHub App] or xref:gitlab-integration#[GitLab]. To find out which GitHub integration type you have refer to the xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App integration] page.

=== Configuration source

Configuration sources show CircleCI where a pipeline configuration for your project is stored. Each configuration source is a pipeline definition.

A project can have one or more configuration sources. Configurations include, but are not limited to, a `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repository. When you create a project in CircleCI and connect it to a repository, a configuraiton source is set up for you automatically, connected to the `.circleci/config.yml` you set up, either by supplying it yourself or by using an generated configuraiton file created through the project onboarding process.

==== Add a configuraiton source

TIP: If you created a project xref:create-a-project#[in the CircleCI web app] you will find a configuration source is already set up.

To add a configuration source, follow these steps:

. In the CircleCI web app, click on **Projects** in the sidebar
. Click on the ellipsis next to your project (icon:ellipsis-h[]) and then click **Project Settings**
. Select **Configuration** in the sidebar
. Click btn:[Add Configuration Source]
. Fill in the form fields and options:
** Give your configuraiton source a descriptive name
** Under Configuration Source select the platform that matches where your project is set up (for example, GitHub App)
** Authorize your connection if this is not already showing with a icon:check-circle[]
** Select your project repository #NEED TO ADD INFO ON WHAT PEOPLE CAN AND CANT DO HERE#
** Select a fallback branch to use in case you try to build on a branch with no configuration defined
** Enter the path to your configuraiton file relative to the root of your repository. For example, `.circleci/config.yml`
. Click btn:[Save]

Once you have set up a configuration source you need to set up a project trigger for the configuration source. This is described in the following section.

[#visual-studio-code-extension]
== VS Code extension

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can also monitor and interact with your pipelines directly from VS Code with the link:/docs/vs-code-extension-overview/[official CircleCI extension]. The extension allows you to customize which projects and pipelines you want to follow, as well as view job logs and test results, download artifacts, approve, re-run, and debug jobs with SSH, and get notified when your workflows fail or need approval.

The CircleCI VS Code extension is available to download on the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=circleci.circleci[VS Code marketplace.]
