CircleCI pipelines are the highest-level unit of work, encompassing a project's full `.circleci/config.yml` file. Pipelines include your workflows, which coordinate your jobs. They have a fixed, linear lifecycle, and are associated with a specific actor. Pipelines trigger when a change is pushed to a project that has a CircleCI configuration file included, and can also be scheduled, triggered manually through the CircleCI app, or using the API.

When visiting your CircleCI dashboard, you are shown a list of recently triggered pipelines for your organization/account.

[#pipeline-architecture]
== Pipeline architecture

A pipeline is composed of workflows, which are composed of jobs. By navigating from a pipeline to a specific job, you can access your job output, test results, and artifacts through several tabs.

The output of each job can be opened in a new tab (in either raw or formatted styling) with a unique link, making it shareable between team members.

[#visual-studio-code-extension]
== VS Code extension

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can also monitor and interact with your pipelines directly from VS Code with the link:/docs/vs-code-extension-overview/[official CircleCI extension]. The extension allows you to customize which projects and pipelines you want to follow, as well as view job logs and test results, download artifacts, approve, re-run, and debug jobs with SSH, and get notified when your workflows fail or need approval.

The CircleCI VS Code extension is available to download on the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=circleci.circleci[VS Code marketplace.]
