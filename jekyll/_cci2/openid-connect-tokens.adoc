In jobs using a <<contexts#,context>>, CircleCI provides an OpenID Connect ID (OIDC) token in an environment variable. A job can use this to access compatible cloud services without a long-lived credential stored in CircleCI.

toc::[]

== OpenID Connect ID token availability

In CircleCI jobs that use at least one context, the OpenID Connect ID token is available in the environment variable `$CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN`.

Add a <<contexts/#creating-and-using-a-context,context to a job>> by adding the `context` key to the <<configuration-reference/#workflows,workflows>> section of your `circleci/config.yml` file:

```yml
workflows:
  my-workflow:
    jobs:
      - run-tests:
          context:
            - my-context
```

== Setting up your cloud service

Consult your cloud service's documentation for how to add an identity provider. For example, AWS's https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html[Creating OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers], or Google Cloud Platform's https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/configuring-workload-identity-federation#oidc[Configuring workload identity federation].

The https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Terminology[OpenID Provider] is unique to your organization. The URL is `\https://oidc.circleci.com/org/ORGANIZATION_ID`, where `ORGANIZATION_ID`` is the organization ID (a universally unique identifier) that represents your organization. You can find your CircleCI organization ID by navigating to **Organization Settings > Overview** on the https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app].

The OpenID Connect ID tokens issued by CircleCI have a fixed audience (see `aud` in the table below), which is also the organization ID.

== Format of the OpenID Connect ID token

The OpenID Connect ID token contains the following standard https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken[claims]:

[%autowidth]
[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Claims
| Description

| `iss`
| The issuer. The issuer is specific to the CircleCI organization in which the job is being run. Its value is `"https://oidc.circleci.com/org/ORGANIZATION_ID"`, a string, where `ORGANIZATION_ID` is a UUID identifying the current job's project's organization.

| `sub`
| The subject. This identifies who is running the CircleCI job and where. Its value is `"org/ORGANIZATION_ID/project/PROJECT_ID/user/USER_ID"`, a string, where `ORGANIZATION_ID`, `PROJECT_ID`, and `USER_ID` are UUIDs that identify the CircleCI organization, project, and user, respectively. The user is the CircleCI user that caused this job to run.

| `aud`
| The audience. Currently, this is a fixed value `"ORGANIZATION_ID"`, a string containing a UUID that identifies the job's project's organization.

| `iat`
| The time of issuance. This is the time the token was created, which is shortly before the job starts.

| `exp`
| The expiration time. Its value is one hour after the time of issuance.
|===


The OpenID Connect ID token also contains some https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AdditionalClaims[additional claims] with extra metadata about the job:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
| Additional claims
| Metadata

| `oidc.circleci.com/project-id`
| The ID of the project in which the job is running. Its value is a string containing a UUID identifying the CircleCI project.

| `oidc.circleci.com/context-ids`
| An array of strings containing UUIDs that identify the context(s) used in the job. Currently, just one context is supported.

==  Authenticate jobs with cloud providers

The following sections describe how to authenticate jobs on CircleCI with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Provider (GCP).

=== AWS

The following AWS instructions are for:

* A one-time configuration of your AWS account to trust CircleCI's OIDC tokens
* Running a job that uses the OIDC token to interact with AWS

==== Setting up AWS

You will need to allow your AWS account to trust CircleCI's OpenID Connect tokens. To do this, create an Identity and Access Management(IAM) identity provider, and an IAM role in AWS (this is a one-time configuration).

Visit the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html[Creating OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers] page of the AWS docs and follow the instructions. You will need your CircleCI Organization ID, which you can find by navigating to **Organization Settings > Overview** on the https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app]. Copy your Organization ID for the next step.

When asked for the **Provider URL**, enter: `\https://oidc.circleci.com/org/ORGANIZATION_ID`, where `ORGANIZATION_ID` is the ID of your CircleCI organization. Provide the same CircleCI Organization ID for the **Audience**.

Next, you will need to create an IAM role. Visit the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html#idp_oidc_Create[Creating a role for web identity or OIDC] section of the AWS docs.

For the trusted entity, select **Web Identity**, then choose the identity provider that you created earlier. For **Audience**, choose the only option, which is **Add Permissions**. This allows you to specify what your CircleCI jobs can and cannot do. Choose only permissions that your job will need, which is an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege[AWS best practice].

**Note:** You may find it useful to create your own policy.

==== Adding AWS to the CircleCI configuration file

Now you are ready to choose the CircleCI jobs in your workflow that you want to receive an OpenID Connect token. Since the OpenID Connect token is only available to jobs that use at least one <<contexts#,context>>, make sure each of the jobs you want to receive an OIDC token uses a context (the context may have no environment variables). 

In your job, use the OpenID Connect token to do AWS STS's https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html[AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity]. Have the following information ready:

* AWS region that you want to operate in
* ARN of the IAM role that you created earlier

Here is an example config that uses the AWS CLI's https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/assume-role-with-web-identity.html[assume-role-with-web-identity subcommand] to authenticate with AWS. It then performs a trivial interaction (`aws sts get-caller-identity`) with AWS, demonstrating that the authentication worked. Replace that demonstration with whatever you want, such as uploading to an S3 bucket, pushing to ECR, or interacting with EKS.

```yml
jobs:
  deploy:
    docker:
      - image: amazon/aws-cli
    environment:
      AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: YOUR_AWS_REGION
      AWS_ROLE_ARN: YOUR_ROLE_ARN
    steps:
      - run:
        name: authenticate-and-interact
        command: |
          # use the OpenID Connect token to obtain AWS credentials
          read -r AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_SESSION_TOKEN \<<< \
            $(aws sts assume-role-with-web-identity \
             --role-arn ${AWS_ROLE_ARN} \
             --role-session-name "CircleCI-${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID}-${CIRCLE_JOB}" \
             --web-identity-token $CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN \
             --duration-seconds 3600 \
             --query 'Credentials.[AccessKeyId,SecretAccessKey,SessionToken]' \
             --output text)
          export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
          # interact with AWS
          aws sts get-caller-identity
```

==== Advanced Usage

You can take advantage of the format of the claims in CircleCI's <<format-of-the-openid-connect-id-token,OIDC token>> to limit what your CircleCI jobs can do in AWS. For example, if certain projects should only be able to access certain AWS resources, you can restrict your IAM role so that only CircleCI jobs in a specific project can assume that role.

To do this, edit your IAM role's trust policy so that only an OIDC token from your chosen project can assume that role. The trust policy determines under what conditions the role can be assumed.

To do this, go to an individual project's page on https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app] and navigate to **Project Settings > Overview** to find your Project ID.

Next, add the following condition to your role's trust policy, so that only jobs in your chosen project can assume that role. Enter your Organization ID for `ORGANIZATION_ID` and your Project ID for `PROJECT_ID`.

```yml
"StringLike": {
  "oidc.circleci.com/org/ORGANIZATION_ID:sub": "org/ORGANIZATION_ID/project/PROJECT_ID/user/*"
}
```

This uses https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html#Conditions_String[StringLike] to match the sub claim of CircleCI's OIDC token in your chosen project. Now, jobs in your other projects cannot assume this role.

=== Google Cloud Provider

The following GCP instructions are for:

* A one-time configuration of your GCP settings to trust CircleCI's OIDC tokens
* Running a job that uses the OIDC token to interact with GCP

The Google Cloud CLI reads your configuration file, which contains necessary information instructing Google Cloud to authenticate. You can read about external identity providers on https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/configuring-workload-identity-federation#oidc[Google Cloud's docs].

==== Setting up GCP

The GCP configuration file can be set up using the GCP UI. In the **Workload Identity Federation UI**, navigate to **Grant Access**, which will prompt the configuration, which can then be downloaded. You will need to create a file named `CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE`, which Google Cloud will read your identity token from.

You will need your CircleCI organization ID, which can be found by navigating to **Organization Settings > Overview** on the https://app.circleci.com/[CircleCI web app].

After navigating to the **Grant Access** section of the GCP UI, follow these steps to add CircleCI as an external identity provider:

1. Navigate to the **IAM & Admin panel**
1. On the side panel, navigate to **Workload Identity Federation**
1. Click the **Add Provider** button
1. Select **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** from the "Select a provider" dropdown and click **Save**
1. Fill out the **Provider details** form
  * Select **Allowed audiences** since the `aud` claim in the JSON Web Token is a UUID (your CircleCI organization ID). The `audience` will be your CircleCI organization ID
  * The issuer is `\https://oidc.circleci.com/org/ORG_ID`, where `ORG_ID` is your CircleCI organization ID
1. Click **Continue** to configure provider attributes
+
Configuring the provider attributes provides an opportunity to map claims in CircleCI's Token to Google's "understanding." For example:
+
[.table.table-striped]
[cols=2*, stripes=even]

|===
| google.subject
| attribute.project_id

| assertion.sub
| assertion['oidc.circleci.com/project-id']
|===
+
1. Navigate to **Service Account** in the IAM & Admin Panel to create a service account, and give appropriate permission
1. Navigate back to **Workload Identity Federation** and select the provider from the table
1. Click the **Grant access** button
1. A modal will open and you will select the service account you created from the dropdown. This is the account that the token will impersonate, which grants all the associated permissions
1. Under **Select principals**, you can add conditions, or leave the default
1. Click **Save**. A pop-up will appear to ask you configure and **download** the configuration file. This file can also be downloaded later by navigating to **Connected Service Accounts**

Keep a copy of the downloaded configuration file.

An example of the configuration file is shown below. Note, the `audience` has not been set up yet with the following:

* PROJECT_NUMBER (the unique identifying number generated for your project)
* POOL_ID (an ID that references the workload identity pool, for example `circleci_oidc`)
* PROVIDER_ID (an ID that references the workload identity pool provider, for example, `circleci`)

```yaml
 {
  "type": "external_account",
  "audience": "//iam.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL_ID/providers/PROVIDER_ID",
  "subject_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt",
  "token_url": "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/token",
  "service_account_impersonation_url": "https://iamcredentials.googleapis.com/v1/projects/-/serviceAccounts/circleci-test@incubator-344312.iam.gserviceaccount.com:generateAccessToken",
  "credential_source": {
    "file": "CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE",
    "format": {
      "type": "text"
    }
  }
}
```

In this configuration, `credential_source` is what will attempt to find your identity token in the `CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE` file.

If your token comes from an API response, it might be useful to set up the configuration to read a JSON file. In this case, the `type` will need to be set to `json` and you will need to provide a valid `path`, for example, `response.id_token`.

```yaml
  "credential_source": {
    "file": "CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE",
    "format": {
      "type": "json",
      "path": "response.id_token"
    }
  }
```

==== Adding GCP to the CircleCI configuration file

You will need to export the `$CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN` to the file named `CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE` by running the following:

```bash
echo $CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN >> CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE
```

Then you need to add the following to a job:

```yml
- run:
  name: Authenticate with GCP
  command: |
    # Configure gcloud to leverage the generated credential configuration
    gcloud auth login --brief --cred-file "${GCP_CREDENTIAL_CONFIGURATION_FILE}"

    # Configure ADC
    # https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/print-access-token
    echo 'export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="${GCP_CREDENTIAL_CONFIGURATION_FILE}"' | tee -a $BASH_ENV

- run:
  name: Verify that gcloud is authenticated
  command: gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy "${GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}"

- run:
  name: Verify that ADC works
  command: |
    ACCESS_TOKEN=$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)
    curl -f -i -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "access_token=${ACCESS_TOKEN}" https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo
```

Please note, if needed, you can also generate the file on the fly by running the following script:

```shell
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \
  "${GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_POOL_AUDIENCE}" \
  --output-file="${GCP_CREDENTIAL_CONFIGURATION_FILE}" \
  --service-account="${GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}" \
  --credential-source-file="${GCP_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE_FILE}"
```
