This template will help you create a new docs page to provide conceptual information about a feature or task in CircleCI. To use this template make a copy and place it in the `_cci2` directory. The filename should match the page title. The opening paragraph should be used to succinctly explain to the reader what value the feature/task provides and what use cases it supports.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

Use the introduction to explain more about the feature/task, what it is for, why it is useful, and the wider context. Try to answer the question “What’s in it for me?” for the reader.

You might want to include an image or diagram here to help illustrate the concept:

image::{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/arch.png[Provide some alt text for images here]

Th docs team can work with you to help create helpful image to support explanitory information.

[#quickstart]
== Quickstart

Some readers will want to read through a full overview page to get a deep understanding of how a feature work, the full set of options available to them, any gotchas or limitations that might apply to them, and find troubleshooting information so they can know what to expect. However, some readers will want to get started with the feature or task right away and then dip back into the docs as needed. For the latter it's a good idea to provide a quickstart section that gets them up and running with the basics in just a few steps.:

// The following will render as a numbered list

. Provide some steps here
. To get started with this feature
. Inlcude a step for every action
. Try not to skip steps or assume readers will know which button to click etc.

Alternatively, point readers to a how-to guide or tutorial in this Quickstart section.

[#how-the-feature-works]
== How the feature works

Consider providing some detail on how the feature works 'under the hood' so readers can better conceptualise what they are doing. You might want to break this down into subsections.

[#this-is-a-subsection-title]
=== This is a subsection title

Break up large blocks of text where possible to help make it easier to consume. You can use bullet lists:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

[#using-tables]
=== Using tables

This is the syntax for creating a table. This example has one heading row and one normal row. The table has three columns

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=3*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
|Header text column 1
|Header text column 2
|Header text column 3

|Text for row 1 column 1
|Text for row 1 column 2
|Text for row 1 column 3
|===

[#links-and-cross-references]
=== Links and cross references

To link out to content outside of the docs use a link:

link:https://circleci.com/[CircleCI website]

To link to another page within the docs use a cross reference:

xref:about-circleci#[About CircleCI]

Notice the `#` at the end of the filename. You can place the subsection anchor there if you want to link to a subsection:

xref:about-circleci#learn-more[About CircleCI]

[#code-examples]
=== Code examples

Use asciidoc source blocks for code:

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2021.04
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: The First Step
          command: |
            echo 'Hello World!'
            echo 'This is the delivery pipeline'
      - run:
          name: The Second Step
          command: |
            ls -al
            echo '^^^The files in your repo^^^'

[#next-steps]
== Next steps

// Here you can inlude links to other pages in docs or the blog etc. where the reader should head next.
