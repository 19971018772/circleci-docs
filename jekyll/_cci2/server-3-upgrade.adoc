In order to upgrade your installation of server v3.x you need to have access to the Kubernetes cluster in which it is installed and have an instance of KOTS admin running. To enter the KOTS admin console, run the following, substituting your CircleCI Server namespace: 

----
kubectl kots admin-console -n <YOUR_CIRCLECI_NAMESPACE>
----

Next, log in to the admin console with the password you created during the installation process.

Once you have logged in select the Version History tab. We always recommend checking for new versions before proceeding, do do this click **Check for Updates**. 

Once you have the most recent versions available, run through this checklist befroe selecting **Deploy** for the version you would like to upgrade to.

NOTE: We recommend that you do not skip releases

* Check the https://circleci.com/server/changelog/[change log] and make sure there are no actions you need to take before deploying a new version. 
* Check the config for the version you are deploying and make sure there are no new fields or features you may be interested in deploying (the gears next to the deploy button will take you to the config version specific to that version). 
* Deploy and run `reality check` in your test environment. Make sure that the most recent version does not do anything unexpected with regards to how you have deployed. 
* Make sure you backup your existing instance. You can quickly backup your instance by visiting snapshots tab in the upper navigation of the admin console. 

A successful deployment will update the UI. Unless noted in the release notes, updates are rolling updates and there is no downtime.
