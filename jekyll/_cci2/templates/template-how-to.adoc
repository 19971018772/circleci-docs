This template will help you create a new docs page that shows the reader how to carry out a task and accomplish a specific goal with CircleCI. Content templates help you to:

* Develop new content quickly
* Ensure your page conforms to the style guide

To use this template, make a copy and place it in the `_cci2` directory. The filename should match the page title. Look at the source file for this page template link:https://github.com/circleci/circleci-docs/blob/master/jekyll/_cci2/template/template-how-to.adoc?plain=1[here]. There is additional detail in the comments.

The opening paragraph should be used to briefly describe to the reader what the reader will do using this guide, and what the outcomes are when they successfully finish the task.

Contributors from within CircleCI can also consider setting up a local development environment to preview changes before pushing. Ping one of the Developer Resources and Engineering team (DRE) for more information.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

You may use the introduction to tell the reader what value the feature/task provides, and what use cases it supports. If possible, display the most relevant or popular use cases in a short bullet list. 

As a guideline, the introduction should try to answer the following questions for the reader:

* Whatâ€™s in it for me?
* How does this feature / task help me create more value?

Consider providing a link to an xref:template-conceptual#[overview or conceptual doc], should the reader be interested in more explanatory or background information regarding the feature or task.

Since the reader will usually want to quickly get to the task at hand, keep the introduction succinct.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

List any prerequisites that the reader needs to have already met in order for them to successfully complete the task. These may include:

// The following will render as an unordered (bullet) list

* Completing a certain task, such as signing up for a CircleCI account and having at least one project building in CircleCI
* Roles and permissions
* Knowledge of or familiarity with a certain topic
// This renders as a nested item
** Link to any helpful documentation or pages that they can refer to, for example, "For more information on how test splitting works, refer to the xref:https://circleci.com/docs/parallelism-faster-jobs#[Test splitting and parallelism] page."
* CircleCI plan

Sometimes, there may be topics that are helpful to know, or tasks to complete, that are _helpful_ in order to successfully finish the how-to guide, but do not necessarily have a severely negative impact on the user's flow if they do those as they go along. For example, you may include generating an API token in the how-to steps itself, rather than listing it as a strict prerequisite. Use your best judgment to decide whether to add such a requirement as a prerequisite or as a step that is part of the how-to.

// The section headings in which you outline the steps should be in an active voice
[#carry-out-the-task]
== Carry out the task

Here you start to enumerate and describe how to accomplish the task step-by-step.

You may also consider adding numbers to the headings to more clearly outline the task flow for the reader, like so:

[source]
----
[#first-step]
== 1. First step
...
[#second-step]
== 2. Second step
----

In a how-to guide, you might walk the reader through an example scenario. Examples should be based on real-world use cases as much as possible and address business objectives.

[#this-is-a-subsection-title]
=== This is a subsection title

Break up large blocks of text where possible to help make it easier to consume. You can use bullet lists:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

[#using-tables]
=== Using tables

This is the syntax for creating a table. This example has one heading row and one normal row. The table has three columns

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=3*, options="header", stripes=even]
|===
|Header text column 1
|Header text column 2
|Header text column 3

|Text for row 1 column 1
|Text for row 1 column 2
|Text for row 1 column 3
|===

For a full description of the options available, including merging cells, and cell formatting, see the link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/tables/build-a-basic-table/[Asciidoctor docs].

[#links-and-cross-references]
=== Links and cross references

To link out to content outside of the docs use a link:

link:https://circleci.com/[CircleCI website]

To link to another page within the docs use a cross reference:

xref:../about-circleci#[About CircleCI]

Notice the `#` at the end of the filename. You can place the subsection anchor there if you want to link to a subsection:

xref:../about-circleci#learn-more[About CircleCI]

[#code-examples]
=== Code examples

Whenever possible, the how-to guide should provide examples that cover our users' most widely used languages and frameworks, unless the guide itself is specific to a particular language, platform, or framework.

Use AsciiDoc source blocks for code examples:

[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2021.04
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: The First Step
          command: |
            echo 'Hello World!'
            echo 'This is the delivery pipeline'
      - run:
          name: The Second Step
          command: |
            ls -al
            echo '^^^The files in your repo^^^'
----

[#banners]
=== Banners

In technical writing we use _admonitions_ to create blocks of content that stand out from the main flow of text. Outside the docs team we usually refer to these as _banners_. Currently we have the option to include notes, cautions, and warnings, as follows:

NOTE: **Need to add a note?** This is how to do it

CAUTION: **Need to add a caution?** This is how to do it

WARNING: **Need to add a warning?** This is how to do it

We try to use a short section in bold at the start of the admonition to try to attract the readers attention.

For more information, see xref:../style/formatting/#using-notes-tips-cautions-warnings[the CircleCI style guide].

[#next-steps]
== Next steps

// Here you can inlude links to other pages in docs or the blog etc. where the reader should head next.
