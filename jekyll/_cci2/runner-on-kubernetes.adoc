NOTE: CircleCI has a new <<container-runner#,container runner>> in open preview which is the recommended approach for using CircleCI's self-hosted runners with Kubernetes.

If you are not using a <<container-runner#,container runner>>, see this link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-runner-k8s[README] for documentation on the old method for using self-hosted runners with Kubernetes.
