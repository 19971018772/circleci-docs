== External Database and Vault Set up for CircleCI Installations
This document describes how to configure the following external services for use with a CircleCI server 3.x installation.

=== PostgreSQL

NOTE: If using your own PostgresSQL instance it needs to be version 12.1 or greater. 

If you select External complete the following Postgres fields: 

*PostgresSQL Service Domain  (required)* - The domain or IP address of your PostgresSQL instance. 

*PostgresSQL Service Port  (required)* - The port of your PostgresSQL instance. 

*PostgresSQL Service Username  (required)* - A user with the appropriate privileges to access your PostgresSQL instance. 

*PostgresSQL Service Password (required)* - The password of the user used to access your PostgresSQL instance. 

==== Best Practices for your PostgreSQL

Consider running at least two or more PostgreSQL replicas to enable recovery from primary failure and for backups. Following are the recommended specifications of the PostgreSQL machines:

[.table.table-striped]
[cols=6*, options="header", stripes=even]

==== Backing Up PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL provides official documentation for backing up and restoring your PostgreSQL 12 install which can be found https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/backup.html[here].

We strongly recommend the following:

* Taking daily backups
* Keeping at least 30 days of backup
* Using encrypted storage for backups as databases might contain sensitive information
* Performing a backup before each upgrade of CircleCI Server.

=== MongoDB

NOTE: If using your own MongoDB instance it needs to be version 3.6 or greater. 

If you select External complete the following MongoDB fields: 

*MongoDB connection host(s) or IP(s) (required)* - 
The hostname or IP of your MongoDB instance. Specifying a port using a colon and multiple hosts for sharded instances are both supported.

*Use SSL for connection to MongoDB (required)* - 
Whether to use SSL when connecting to your external MongoDB instance

*Allow insecure TLS connections (required)* - 
If you use a self-signed certificate or one signed by a custom CA, you will need to enable this setting. However, this is an insecure setting and you should use a TLS certificate signed by a valid CA if you can.

*MongoDB user (required)* - 
The user name for the account to use. This account should have the dbAdmin role.

*MongoDB password (required)* - 
The password for the account to use.

*MongoDB authentication source database (required)* - 
The database that holds the account information, usually admin.

*MongoDB authentication mechanism (required)* - 
The authentication mechanism to use, usually SCRAM-SHA-1.

*Additional connection options (optional)* - 
Any other connection options you would like to use. This needs to be formatted as a query string (key=value pairs, separated by &, special characters need to be URL encoded). See the link:https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.6/reference/connection-string/[MongoDB docs] for available options.

=== Vault

Complete the following Vault fields: 

==== Artifact and Encryption Signing Settings
Encryption and artifact signing keys were created during prerequisites. You can enter them here now. 

Complete the following fields: 

*Artifact Signing Key (required)*

*Encryption Signing Key (required)*
